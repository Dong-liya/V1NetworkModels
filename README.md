### V1 Network Models

Network models of primary visual cortex (V1) based on spiking point neurons.

A number of published network models of V1 will be investigated, scripts reproducing some of their features will be added to this repository (in PyNN and NeuroML formats), and as they develop, will be copied out into dedicated repositories on GitHub/OSB for specific publications.

See the [Wiki](http://www.opensourcebrain.org/projects/v1networkmodels/wiki) for more details.
